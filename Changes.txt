All code that has been replaced has been commented out 



-Renamed gameObject 'Asteroid Spawner' to '_Asteroid Manager'

-Added class 'AsteroidDestroyer' to gameObject '_Asteroid Manager'

-Defined class 'AsteroidSet' with a dictionary that contains all asteroids 
that are currently in game aswell with register and deregister functions.

-Moved function 'Destroy Asteroid' to class 'AsteroidDestroyer' without any
dependency injection.

when ship dies.
